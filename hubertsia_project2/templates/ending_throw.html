        <h1>Ending — A Cheesy Evening</h1>
        <p>
            You throw a block of cheese at the ringleader. Silence falls — and then laughter erupts.
            Turns out, they really like cheese! You successfully win everyone over and are treated
            to a peaceful night in the tavern.
        </p>
        <p class="whisper">You’ve earned your rest... and some extra cheese.</p>
