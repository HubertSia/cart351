        <p>
            You stride over and ask them to quiet down. One glare later, the entire tavern freezes —
            and then they scatter. Everyone stares at you in awe.
        </p>
        <p>
            You grin, take a triumphant sip... and realize your drink was much stronger than you thought.
            The world tilts sideways.
        </p>
        <p class="whisper">Maybe you overdid it... again.</p>
