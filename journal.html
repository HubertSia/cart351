                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <article>
                    Week 1 is mostly an introduction to the API server and web development.
                    We are mainly introducing the back-end side of web development.
                    Fortunately, we are going to use Python as our main programming language instead of PHP.
                    Thank goodness, because I don’t want to go through the struggle of building custom templates
                    in PHP or WordPress again (no offense, Sabine!).

                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <article>
                    Week 2 focused on networks and navigation. I had a bit of trouble installing Python on both of my
                    machines,
                    but I got it working in the end. Surprisingly, in terms of programming, everything was mostly
                    straightforward.
                    So far, we’re only doing things through the console, but it already feels much livelier than a
                    boring old terminal
                    just showing the server launch. It makes the terminal feel more active and engaging — a great asset!
                    We’re not quite into the web-dev side yet, so hopefully, coding will stay as simple as it gets.

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 3</h4>
                <article>
                    Week 3 — now we’re getting into the good stuff! Being able to grab API data and use it in Python is
                    wonderful.
                    It’s important too, since we’re actually using real-time data in our programming. I think I finally
                    understand
                    why people say Python is better for back-end work. We’re about to start touching HTML soon, so
                    hopefully that goes well.
                    The exercise doesn’t look too hard, so I might have enough time to completely comment my code and
                    solutions.
                    Now I’m starting to wonder about the Project 1 assignment.

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 4</h4>
                <article>
                    Week 4 already!? Time flies when you’re having fun. This week we’re starting to learn how to use
                    Python to interact with HTML.
                    It seems like a lot, but it’s best to take it one step at a time. Otherwise, it’s straightforward as
                    usual, thanks to the notes.
                    As for Project 1 — it’s console-related. Maybe I could try to code a choose-your-own-adventure type
                    of game,
                    like the one we saw back in CART 215. Certainly, I know someone who would love it.

                <h4>Week 5</h4>
                <article>
                    Unfortunately, Project 1 had to take a different direction due to the use of the air-quality API.
                    I managed to finish the project on time. It turned into a kind of virtual Russian roulette using the
                    air-quality API,
                    which I absolutely had fun programming. Although, too bad we couldn’t learn anything new this week
                    due to the Concordia strike.
                    Not to mention, people were blocking the lab, so I was stuck inside the class with another
                    classmate. We eventually got out,
                    but those striking really need a better way to spread their precious message.

                <h4>Week 5 or 6 (delay)</h4>
                <article>
                    I probably started to lose count of the weeks here due to the strike delay and the lecture break.
                    After returning from the midterm, we learned a bit about Flask Apps — Python web applications.
                    They’re basically what make the connection between the web browser and Python, linked by the Apache
                    web server (port 80).

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 7</h4>
                <article>
                    During the second introduction to Python and Flask, things started to feel more familiar with PHP.
                    Just like PHP’s way of handling templates, Python’s Flask uses a similar method. For example, we use
                    a <code>base.html</code> file
                    to connect with the header of an <code>index.html</code> or any other page. What’s uniquely great is
                    that we don’t need WordPress
                    to test it—we can simply run Flask locally and use <code>localhost</code> to see our work.
                    There’s also a lot of functionality like <code>render_template</code> that loads HTML and variables.
                    But if I keep explaining, this section would probably take up 70% of the entire web!

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 8 (Part 1)</h4>
                <article>
                    The third part of Flask is quite interesting. This week we learned about session management for
                    storing user data across requests,
                    which basically lets us fetch data asynchronously. This allows for real-time updates without
                    reloading pages.
                    It also enables file uploads using Flask routes and FormData.

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 8 (Part 2)</h4>
                <article>
                    For the fourth part of Flask, we mostly focused on integration. We learned how to use I/O files and
                    JSON to load data and strings.
                    Just like we saw in Pinpin’s class, we can reuse data with JSON, integrate it into a website, and
                    even store user input back into the JSON file.
                    This gave me a good idea for a choose-your-own-adventure type website for the second project,
                    where player choices are recorded and later displayed from a JSON file.

            <section class="article">
                <h4>Week 9/10</h4>
                <article>
                    I managed to complete the choose-your-own-adventure project for the submission on November 12.
                    It not only recorded choices in JSON but also used <code>base.html</code>,
                    <code>render_template</code>, and other lessons from previous weeks.
                    Today’s topic was MongoDB — it was a bit complicated at first, but I see the potential in using it
                    to analyze or keep data.
                    It’s kind of like tracking users, but instead of relying on third-party services like Google,
                    MongoDB allows custom, internal data analysis.

                <h4>Week 11/12</h4>
                <article>
                    After learning to use Flask with WebSocket, building the third project concept proved to be a
                    challenge.
                    Even finding an API for it was tricky. I wondered if there was an API for cheeses that I could use
                    creatively.
                    Turns out, when you search “API cheese,” most of it is about bioscience molecules, not food.
                    Looks like I needed to dig deeper.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in development, I realized that the API was optional for the final project,
                    so I went on a bit of a wild goose chase last week.
                    With that in mind, I decided to reuse the Mood-Plant project as a base,
                    reworking it into a cheese-themed web app that incorporates Flask Socket I/O and MongoDB.
                    <br><br>
                    Much later, after presenting the full code, it turns out the teacher really liked the “cheesy”
                    project in the end.
                    We went through all the code and the demonstration, and something so simple turned out to be quite
                    fascinating once developed.
                    I do think the cheese theme played a big part in that!

                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                <article>
                    This has been a really great class. Not only did I gain a sense of familiarity
                    by comparing PHP and Python side by side, but I also learned many new concepts.
                    Running a server doesn’t need WordPress or PHP to handle data and websites.
                    On a smaller scale, Python, JSON, MongoDB, and its many libraries work wonderfully together
                    for both back-end and front-end web development.
                    Overall, it was a wonderful experience learning Python, and it opened a path
                    for many future creative projects.
