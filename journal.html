            <h4> Week 1 </h4>  
            <article>
           Week 1 is mostly an introduction to the API server with the web developpement.
            We will be mostly introducing the Back-End side of the web developpement. 
            Fortunatly, we are going to use Python as our main programming langauge instead of PHP. Thank GOOOODNNESSS, cause I don't want to go to the struggle of doing the 
            whole custom template PHP and Wordpress again (no offense Sabine :) ).

            <h4> Week 2 </h4>
            <article>
            Week 2 on networks and navigation, a bit trouble of installing Python in both of my machines but I got it work at the end. Suprinsingly, in terms of programming,
            it is mostly straightfoward at it goes. We're only doing stuff that it is at the console so far but it does bring it more lively then a boring old terminal that indicates the launch server.
            It makes it feel the terminal more lively and a great asset too. We're not getting into the web-dev side yet so hopefully coding will be simple as it gets.

        <h4> Week 3 </h4>
            <article>
            Week 3, noow we're getting in the good stuff, able to to grab API data and use it in Python does wonders. Important too, cause we're actually using real time
            data to apply in our programming. I think I understand why my folks back in cegep are saying this is much more better for back-end. We're getting to touching the html soon, so hopefully it goes well.
            Plus, the exercice doesn't look too hard, I might have time to completly comment my work and solution fully. Now make me wonder about the Project 1 assignement.

            <h4> Week 4 </h4>
            <article>
           WEEK 4 ALREADY!? Time flies fast when you're having fun. Also, now we're starting to learn to use Python that affects the html this week too. It seems a lot but is best to nibble down on at the time. Otherwise, straighfoward as usual thanks to the notes.
           As for the Project 1, is console related, maybe I could try to code in some "chose your own adventure' type of game like we we're shown back in
           back in CART 215. Centainly, I know someone who will love it.
