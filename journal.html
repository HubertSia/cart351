            <h4> Week 1 </h4>  
            <article>
           Week 1 is mostly an introduction to the API server with the web developpement.
            We will be mostly introducing the Back-End side of the web developpement. 
            Fortunatly, we are going to use Python as our main programming langauge instead of PHP. Thank GOOOODNNESSS, cause I don't want to go to the struggle of doing the 
            whole custom template PHP and Wordpress again (no offense Sabine :) ).

            <h4> Week 2 </h4>
            <article>
            Week 2 on networks and navigation, a bit trouble of installing Python in both of my machines but I got it work at the end. Suprinsingly, in terms of programming,
            it is mostly straightfoward at it goes. We're only doing stuff that it is at the console so far but it does bring it more lively then a boring old terminal that indicates the launch server.
            It makes it feel the terminal more lively and a great asset too. We're not getting into the web-dev side yet so hopefully coding will be simple as it gets.

        <h4> Week 3 </h4>
            <article>
            Week 3, noow we're getting in the good stuff, able to to grab API data and use it in Python does wonders. Important too, cause we're actually using real time
            data to apply in our programming. I think I understand why my folks back in cegep are saying this is much more better for back-end. We're getting to touching the html soon, so hopefully it goes well.
            Plus, the exercice doesn't look too hard, I might have time to completly comment my work and solution fully. Now make me wonder about the Project 1 assignement.

            <h4> Week 4 </h4>
            <article>
           WEEK 4 ALREADY!? Time flies fast when you're having fun. Also, now we're starting to learn to use Python that affects the html this week too. It seems a lot but is best to nibble down on at the time. Otherwise, straighfoward as usual thanks to the notes.
           As for the Project 1, is console related, maybe I could try to code in some "chose your own adventure' type of game like we we're shown back in
           back in CART 215. Centainly, I know someone who will love it.

            <h4> Week 5 </h4>
            <article>
           Unfortunaltly, Project 1 has to be taken a different direction, due of the usage of the air-quality API. Manage to finish the project on time.
           It was a virtual russian-roulette of using the air-quality API, wich i have aboslutly had fun of programing it and having fun. Although, too bad we couldn't learn anything this week
           Due to the strike at Concordia, not to mention people we're blocking the lab and I was stuck inside in the class with another classmate. We got out eventually but the people 
           for the strike do need a better way of spreading there pecious message.

        <h4> Week 5 or 6 (delay)</h4>
            <article>
            I'm probably to lose count of the weeks starting there due to the delay of the strike and the lecture week.
            After returning for the mid-term, we learn a bit of a introduction of Flask App wich are Python Web Application.
            There basically what makes the connection between web browser and python link byy Apache Web Server (the whole port 80 server).

        <h4> Week 7</h4>
            <article>
            By the second intro of Python and Flask. This is where it's closely familiar with PHP ways for handling templates. Just like PHP ways of handling templates,
            Python's uses similar heading to make the connection. For example: We use a base.html file to make the connection
            with the header of the index.html or what ever we could use. What is most uniquely good is that we dont need to use
            Wordpress to see the effects if it works. We could simply use the Flask library to make a locohost server
            Too see it. There's also a lot of things like render_template that load the the html and returning the variables as
            well. But if I continue explaining, this section will take up 70% of the web.

            <h4> Week 8</h4>
            <article>
            The third part of Flask is kinda interesting. This is where we learn on session management for storing user data across requests. Wich could be sums it up as a way to use fetch data asynchronously.
            This allows to have real-time updates without reloading the pages. It also allows also to upload files by using the Flask routes and using FormData

            <article>
            For the 4th part of Flask, we moslty see the integration part of it. Abile to use I/O files and .json to load datas and strings. Just like seen with Pinpin's class,
            We're able to reuse data thanks to json and integrate them in a website and in return, storing data in the json itself.  This could give a good idea for a "Chose your own adventure"
            type website for the second project able to registered players choice and later shown from a json file.
